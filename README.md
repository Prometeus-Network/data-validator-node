## How to test

[Here](http://178.128.240.29/) is an instance of app, which is alreay deployed at the stage environent for the demo purposes. 
So you can test all the essence features of the application using UI: 
- upload Data Owners' files with their metadata;
- browse uploaded Data Owners' files list;
- browse the sales transactions list;
- select PROM wallet as the default for the uploads;
- browse the sales transactions list.

Here is a [manual](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/data-validator-node/blob/master/test.md) with screenshots: testing guideline for the operations listed above.

## How it works

Ignite is a decentralized microblogging service powered by Bittorrent and public blockchain. In its essence, Ignite represents a set of independent and equitable nodes.Main features of Ignite : 

1.	It can not be blocked by any form of barrier or firewall, because it uses: 
 - BTFS engine stores ALL of its stuff and nobody can block BTT really effectively yet.
 - We use Ethereum blockchain to authenticate users and nodes and nobody can block it too! 
 - Authentication is done through blockchain; 
2.	Ignite is Immutable: data is stored forever on a distributed data storage BTFS/SOTER;
3.	Community driven: no centralized administration or governance.

All the posts texts and media attached to them are stored in the Distributed Data Storage (DDS). DDS is secure file storage for able to store necessary data and media for a period of 10-100 years. This ensures information immutability and censorship resistance. Our current version of DDS uses [Soter](https://gitlab.com/btfs_ignite). It stores all data we need to exchange between nodes. 

```
Note: speed of DDS files retrieval is far lower than what is needed to implement smooth UX. 
```
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to resolve this issue. It is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. Its goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. CND basically serves as a cache that is synched with DDS (which can be considered as an immutable backup in this scheme). 

To make CDN censorship-resistant as well, we use [Skynet](https://blog.sia.tech/skynet-bdf0209d6d34) (CDN presented by Sia).
Due to the blockchain nature of Ignite, authentication is done through a PROM crypto wallet (ERC20). 

## How to run

### Prerequisites

In order to run Data Mart node, you have to install:
- Docker. You can find installation instructions on [official website](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker-compose, which can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Create and configure `bootstrap-nodes.json` file if you don't want to use default bootstrap nodes. This file contains 
information about bootstrap nodes which help to discover other nodes in network. Below is the content of default `bootstrap-nodes.json` file:
```
{
  "bootstrapNodes": [
    {
      "ipAddress": "188.166.37.102",
      "port": 2000,
      "libp2pAddress": "/ip4/188.166.37.102/tcp/12345/p2p/QmekndSMXKCGLFXp4peHpf9ynLWno6QFbo1uqMq8HBPqtz"
    },
    {
      "ipAddress": "134.209.95.239",
      "port": 2000,
      "libp2pAddress": "/ip4/134.209.95.239/tcp/12346/p2p/QmaF43H5yth1nGWBF4xYEkqaL7X4uUsGNr3vhFbsAWnje6"
    }
  ]
}
```
- If you want to run Data Mart node outside of Docker container, you will need to install
    - NodeJS of latest version, which can be found on the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
    - Yarn. Its installation instruction is also available on
    [Yarn's official website](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable).

### Build and run process

Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-back-end.git```

#### Running inside Docker

In order to run Data Validator node inside Docker container, you need to do the following:

- Create`.env` file in project's **root** directory and configure environmental variables. It is required to configure environmental 
variables for both backend and front-end applications
    - You can find description of environmental variables for [backend](#backend) and [front-end](#front-end) below
- While in project directory, run the following command:

```docker-compose up --build``` or ```docker-compose up --build -d``` if you want to run the application in detached mode.

## Current Stage of project

What Validator node can do now:

- It creates data owners and uploads files to Prometeus network;
- It allows to prolong file storage duration;
- It can show history of data sales.
